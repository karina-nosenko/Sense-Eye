# General view
* Output center points with coordinates for ball
* Output the 'object class name' and 'precision value' in small near the coordinates

# For each player detect the direction of movement
* Explore whether 'optical flow' is useful
* If not - detect it by comparing center point from the current and previous frame

# For each player detect its id
* Image processing for the color of the cap

# Detect the coordinates of the gates and field
* Check whether yolov7 knows to detect conuses
