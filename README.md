# Welcome to Sense-Eye system!

## Introduction
Sense-Eye aims to help impaired vision 5-a-side football players to act more independently during the training and the game/training, analyse the training/game after the session, and receive feedback for self improvement.

## System Overview
Paralympic 5-a-side football was revealed as an event with the highest incidence of injury. There are more challenges impaired vision players encounter during the game and the training, such as  lack of feedback, difficulty in passing the ball, lack of spatial orientation in the field which makes it much harder to know the goal’s location. Sense-Eye provides a solution to address these problems and to make the football game more accessible for the impaired vision community.

## Purpose
The purpose of the Sense-Eye project is to help impaired vision 5-a-side football players become more independent during training and games by providing real-time assistance and feedback to improve their performance. The system is designed to provide recommendations for passing or kicking the ball in real-time, and also alerts the players about the distance to the goal. The system also allows for post-training analysis, providing detailed feedback about the player's performance at the end of the game or training session. This feedback can be used by the coach to confirm if the system's recommendation was good, and by the players to make adjustments to improve their performance. In summary, The project main goal is to help visually impaired players to play football more independently and improve their performance.
## Scope
The system specialises in making the game/training more accessible to impaired vision players by providing the ability to ask for a recommendation for the direction of passing/kicking the ball in real time including post training which the coach will confirm for each event if it was a good recommendation or not. Providing a real-time alert about the distance to the gate. In addition, the system will provide detailed feedback about the player’s performance at the end of the game or training.
## Repository Overview
The SenseEye System comprises several components, each contributing to the overall functionality of the project. This repository is organized into the following main sections:
1. <b>Hardware Unit</b>: This section contains the code and documentation related to the hardware components of the SenseEye System. The hardware unit includes the smart caps equipped with audio signals for real-time feedback and recommendations.
2. <b>Image Processing Unit</b>: In this section, you will find the implementation and details of the image processing unit of the SenseEye System. This unit is responsible for player and ball tracking using computer vision techniques.
3. <b>Recommendations Unit</b>: The recommendations unit is a vital component of the SenseEye System. It provides real-time guidance to visually impaired players by calculating and delivering optimal directions for passing and kicking the ball.
4. <b>Desktop Application</b>: The desktop application offers coaches and trainers a user-friendly interface to analyze and validate the system's recommendations, as well as gain insights into player performance.
